// Package diff implements an algorithm for producing edit-scripts.
// The edit-script is a sequence of operations needed to transform one list
// of symbols into another (or vice-versa). The edits allowed are insertions,
// deletions, and modifications. The summation of all edits is called the
// Levenshtein distance as this problem is well-known in computer science.
//
// This package prioritizes performance over accuracy. That is, the run time
// is more important than obtaining a minimal Levenshtein distance.

	// by Eugene W. Myers. Since D can be as large as N itself, this is
	// effectively O(N^2). Unlike the algorithm from that paper, we are not
	// interested in the optimal path, but at least some "decent" path.
	//
	// For example, let X and Y be lists of symbols:
	//	X = [A B C A B B A]
	//	Y = [C B A B A C]
	//
	// The edit-graph can be drawn as the following:
	//	   A B C A B B A
	//	  ┌─────────────┐
	//	C │_|_|\|_|_|_|_│ 0
	//	B │_|\|_|_|\|\|_│ 1
	//	A │\|_|_|\|_|_|\│ 2
	//	B │_|\|_|_|\|\|_│ 3
	//	A │\|_|_|\|_|_|\│ 4
	//	C │ | |\| | | | │ 5
	//	  └─────────────┘ 6
	//	   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
	//
	// List X is written along the horizontal axis, while list Y is written
	// along the vertical axis. At any point on this grid, if the symbol in
	// list X matches the corresponding symbol in list Y, then a '\' is drawn.
	// The goal of any minimal edit-script algorithm is to find a path from the
	// top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, while traveling through the
	// fewest horizontal or vertical edges.
	// A horizontal edge is equivalent to inserting a symbol from list X.
	// A vertical edge is equivalent to inserting a symbol from list Y.
	// A diagonal edge is equivalent to a matching symbol between both X and Y.

// Invariants:
//	• 0 ≤ fwdPath.X ≤ (fwdFrontier.X, revFrontier.X) ≤ revPath.X ≤ nx
//	• 0 ≤ fwdPath.Y ≤ (fwdFrontier.Y, revFrontier.Y) ≤ revPath.Y ≤ ny
//
// In general:
//	• fwdFrontier.X < revFrontier.X
//	• fwdFrontier.Y < revFrontier.Y
// Unless, it is time for the algorithm to terminate.

// Forward search frontier
// Reverse search frontier

// Search budget bounds the cost of searching for better paths.
// The longest sequence of non-matching symbols that can be tolerated is
// approximately the square-root of the search budget.
// O(n)

// The algorithm below is a greedy, meet-in-the-middle algorithm for
// computing sub-optimal edit-scripts between two lists.
//
// The algorithm is approximately as follows:
//	• Searching for differences switches back-and-forth between
//	a search that starts at the beginning (the top-left corner), and
//	a search that starts at the end (the bottom-right corner). The goal of
//	the search is connect with the search from the opposite corner.
//	• As we search, we build a path in a greedy manner, where the first
//	match seen is added to the path (this is sub-optimal, but provides a
//	decent result in practice). When matches are found, we try the next pair
//	of symbols in the lists and follow all matches as far as possible.
//	• When searching for matches, we search along a diagonal going through
//	through the "frontier" point. If no matches are found, we advance the
//	frontier towards the opposite corner.
//	• This algorithm terminates when either the X coordinates or the
//	Y coordinates of the forward and reverse frontier points ever intersect.
//
// This algorithm is correct even if searching only in the forward direction
// or in the reverse direction. We do both because it is commonly observed
// that two lists commonly differ because elements were added to the front
// or end of the other list.
//
// Running the tests with the "cmp_debug" build tag prints a visualization
// of the algorithm running in real-time. This is educational for
// understanding how the algorithm works. See debug_enable.go.
